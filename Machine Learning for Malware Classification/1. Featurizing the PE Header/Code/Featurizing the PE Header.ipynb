If these files were to be manipulated the system would be effectively \"owned\" by the attacker as these processes cannot be stopped or removed and leave a functional system behind.  The fact that these are called so often leads one to believe there must be a bug in the system which allows for access to these DLLs when there should not be access.  As all of these are loaded into main memory (aside from the Kernel) it may have to do with this process.  It could also have to do with hijacking the auto-load functionality behind these, as most, if not all, of the above processes run at boot of the Windows system."
