# AI-in-Cybersecurity
Programs worked on in university course for Artificial Intelligence in the scope of Cybersecurity.  Specifically, homework problems and challenges.  All notebooks can be reviewed here and any interactions will require access to Jupyter Notebooks either on a virtual environment on a host or through use of a platform such as Google Collab.

## Getting Started

To run these notebooks on a local system or hosted environment through an online platform, download the notebook and any associated datasets.  Going into the Jupyter Notebooks environment, upload and run the notebook itself.  Uploading the data may require different steps depending on how you're running the notebook.
